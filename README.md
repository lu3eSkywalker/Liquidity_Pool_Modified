# Liquidity_Pool_Modified


This repository contains the code for a **Factory Contract** designed to  deploy Liquidity Pool Smart Contracts. Instead of deploying individual smart contracts for each liquidity pool, users can use this factory contract to create multiple liquidity pools.

### Liquidity Pool Contract
Each liquidity pool created by the factory supports the following features:
#### 1. Add Liquidity
#### 2. Remove Liquidity
#### 3. Get Current Liquidity

## How to Use

1. **Deploy the Factory Contract** Deploy the factory contract.
2. **Create a Liquidity Pool** Use the factory contract's function to deploy a new liquidity pool.
3. **Interact with the Liquidity Pool** Once deployed, interact with the liquidity pool using the provided functions (add, remove, or get liquidity).
